# DICETOSSR
DiceTossr is a Python script that simulates the "radioactive dice" experiment and plots a histogram of the results after 5 throws.

## The radioactive dice experiment
The 'radioactive dice' experiment is a classic in school science labs. It's like a hands-on way to grasp the concept of radioactive decay. You start with a bunch of regular dice, roll them all at once, and any that show a specific number (like six) are considered "decayed," just like radioactive nuclei. You take those out and count what's left, representing the undecayed nuclei. Then, you roll the remaining dice again, removing any that show the target number, and count what's left. Repeat this process a few times, and you'll see the number of undecayed dice decrease over time, mimicking radioactive decay.

## Usage
It's quite simple. Run the program, enter the amount of times you want the simulation to run and wait for it to finish the simulation. Note that a higher number of simulations will make the histogram look more similar to the bionmial distribution curve.

## Requirements
To run this program you will need to install Python (duh) as well as MatPlotLib and the random library if you havenâ€™t already.
